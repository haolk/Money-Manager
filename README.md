# Money Manager
Money Manager is an application which can help you to keep record of your personal finance. Many of us don't maintain document of how much money we get in a month and how much expense because that seems very painy to us. This application will help us to keep a record of our every transaction.

# Technologies
Here I use Model–view–controller(MVC) architecture to build this application. Tecnologies I used are
  - Java
  - JavaFX Framework
  - FXML
  - JavaScript
  - JQuery
  - json-simple
  - Collection Frameworks

# Workthrough
Money Manager have three main focusing window
1. Make A Transaction
2. Settings
3. Transaction History

When you Signed In, program shows the "Dashboard" window first. You can initialize your wallet balance using "Adjust Balance" button from Expense Tab in Make A Transaction window. 

Here I added some very short videos to show how can you use Money-Manager. I suggest, please see them to understand how it works.

### Make A Transaction
In a transaction process there happens mainly two thing, one how to money get/add to account and other is how to expense/give from account. Money Manager have get money, expense, borrow, lend, bank transaction to fullfill those needs.
